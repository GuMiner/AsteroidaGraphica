# World Generation Configuration
# Deformation values randomly affect the spherical archetype that is generated for all objects.
# Note that axis deformation is a percent (20% = 0.20) value, whereas per-point deformation is absolute.
# Triangle sizes affect how coarse or fine-grained the object (and per-vertex deformation) is.

# Note that the sun base color is set from within sunRender.fs.
